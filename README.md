# ECE4076
Interactive class notebooks for ECE4076 Computer Vision.

ECE4076 is a computer vision unit at Monash University, covering both classical computer vision and modern deep learning methods. These notebooks are in class activities used alongside pre-recorded lectures covering more detailed material, and paired with laboratory sessions where students implement related concepts.  

- Week 1: Image handling and basic manipulation, high dimensional signals [(notebook)](https://github.com/mgb45/ECE4076/blob/main/Week%201%20-%20Image%20handling%20and%20basic%20operations.ipynb)
- Week 2: Image filtering, Difference of Gaussians, Keypoint Detection, Patch Matching using SSD [(notebook)](https://github.com/mgb45/ECE4076/blob/main/Week%202%20-%20Image%20Filtering%20and%20Patch%20Matching.ipynb)
- Week 3: Invariances and image transformations, assymetric feature matching [(notebook)](https://github.com/mgb45/ECE4076/blob/main/Week%203%20-%20Invariances%20and%20Trees.ipynb)
- Week 4: Camera models and homography estimation using RANSAC [(notebook)](https://github.com/mgb45/ECE4076/blob/main/Week%204%20-%20Camera%20models%20and%20homographies.ipynb)
- Week 5: Camera projection and vanishing points and lines [(notebook)](https://github.com/mgb45/ECE4076/blob/main/Week%205%20-%20Vanishing%20points%20and%20lines.ipynb)
- Week 6: Multiple view geometry, space carving [(notebook)](https://github.com/mgb45/ECE4076/blob/main/Week%206%20-%20Stereo%20vision%20and%20space%20carving.ipynb)
